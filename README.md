All the files will be shown.
The user then chooses among the four file processing algorithms 1-4. Enter 'q' to quit the program.

If 1 is chosen, a record ID must be entered to access the demanded information. If the record ID does not exist, it prints the time taken to search the whole directory. 

If 2 is chosen, a key i.e. a name must be entered to access the demanded information.

If 3 is chosen, records are searched randomly throughout the directory and the record ID and name must be entered to access the demanded information.

If 4 is chosen, the specific file directories or files boundaries must be entered. A record has to be entered as well. Make sure the file limits are within the shown files display
